# UtilityLibrary
This repository contains a C++ utility library, developed in Visual Studio, designed to provide a collection of common, optimized tools for videogame C++ development. The library includes a mathematical module for vector and quaternion operations, ideal for projects requiring efficient mathematical calculations and data manipulation in 2D, 3D, and 4D spaces.

## Repository Content

### Vectors and Quaternion
Classes for handling vectors and quaternions:
- `Quaternion.h` - A quaternion class that supports common mathematical operations with quaternions.
- `Vector2.h` - A class representing 2D vectors, supporting basic mathematical operations.
- `Vector3.h` - A class representing 3D vectors, supporting basic mathematical operations.
- `Vector4.h` - A class representing 4D vectors, supporting basic mathematical operations.

### Utilities
- `EngineMath.h` Contains the necessary mathematical functions to support vector operations. Currently, it only includes methods to calculate absolute values, square roots using Newton and Newton-Raphson methods, and basic trigonometric functions (sin, cos, and tan).
